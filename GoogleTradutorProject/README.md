# Google Translate Language Detection Project

I have created this project based on Google Tradutor Language Detection. 
If you've used Google Translate, you may have noticed that when typing a text, the algorithm identifies the language of that text.
That is exactly what I did using my language detection algorithm and creating a web API from it.
You can check the final result below:
